# Data Analysis with Python

## üìÑ Summary
This repository offers a comprehensive guide to data analysis using Python, focusing on key libraries and techniques. It covers a wide spectrum of topics, from importing and exporting data using Pandas to handling missing values, data formatting, normalization, and categorical variables. It explores descriptive statistics, grouping, data correlation, and hypothesis testing using the Chi-Squared test. The repository delves into linear regression, polynomial regression, model evaluation through visualization, overfitting and underfitting, regularization with ridge regression, and model selection using grid search techniques. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications, learners are equipped to perform in-depth data analysis and create effective predictive models using Python.
