### Definition of Data Science
Data science is the study of extracting knowledge from data, frequently with an emphasis on leveraging massive amounts of data in various formats to address issues and add value. It can encompass the whole data lifecycle, including data collection, analysis, modeling, and solution implementation. By using programming expertise, analytical thinking, and scientific procedures, data scientists perform data science. As data should be utilized to solve issues, drive narratives, and aid in smart decision making, in addition to the technical parts of data science, story-telling is another crucial ability employed by data scientists.
