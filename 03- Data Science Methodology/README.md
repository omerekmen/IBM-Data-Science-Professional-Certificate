# Data Science Methodology

## üìÑ Summary 
This repository is dedicated to exploring the data science methodology, particularly focusing on the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Process for Data Mining) framework. It guides learners through the six key stages of the CRISP-DM methodology, from understanding business problems and data requirements to modeling, evaluation, deployment, and feedback. Through case studies, decision tree building, and data handling exercises, participants gain practical experience in applying the methodology to real-world scenarios. By the end of this repository, learners will have a solid understanding of data science processes, model evaluation, and iterative deployment, positioning them to effectively solve complex business problems using data-driven approaches.
